## About myself:

On July 1, 2021, I graduated from secondary vocational education with a degree in public catering technician with honors. Also this year I entered the Razumovsky Moscow State University of Technology with a degree in public catering technology, restaurateur. 
But they always ask me why I decided to study web development in addition to this? The answer is simple. I believe that everyone should have at least two favorite things and I always liked that, but I never knew where to start.
A little later, I got a man who told me about his studies at RS School and advised me to sign up for them. I started training not so long ago, but I hope that everything will work out for me.
